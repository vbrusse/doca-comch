The purpose of this research project is to investigate the offloading and hw acceleration of the compute-intensive LDPC function from the O-DU High-PHY layer of the 5G NR in a NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPU, according to O-RAN 7.2x split, to enhance this function performance (throughput, latency and energy efficiency).
